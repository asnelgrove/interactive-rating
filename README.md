### Description

My solution to frontendmentor.io challenge "Interactive rating". The user selects and submits a rating out of 5 and sees a thank-you message with a summary of the rating chosen.

### React

I have built this project with React.js in order to leverage the useState hook and conditional rendering, making it possible to store the user's rating choice as state and render the thank-you message without navigation.

### Style
Basic CSS. Color scheme and font-family dictated by frontendmentor.io.
